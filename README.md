## Talking Points

From a [recent slashdot article](https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/05/19/200225/ibm-warns-quantum-computing-will-break-encryption) 

> "What I wonder is, if encryption can be 'instantly broken,' does this also mean that remaining crypto-coins can be instantly discovered?"

The following whitepaper attempts to answer some of these questions: https://github.com/theQRL/Whitepaper/blob/master/QRL_whitepaper.pdf
